# Take Home Test Thinking Process:

- Starting ~9am
- Using KOTA to plan out project based on specifications described during our meeting
- Using Aider for simple commands for setting up the frontend and backend templates
- Telling AI agent's to dial it back on how much to implement at once for easier iteration
- Correcting the agent to NOT create a new project file
- Backend and frontend templates setup (9:10am)
- Setting up minimalistic frontend that connnects to the backend on a new git branch to avoid agent mistakes causing problems
